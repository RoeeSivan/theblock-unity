## RESUME HERE

**Next action:** play-test U6 — walk Joe around downtown and say whether the movement feels right.

U6 is built and compiles clean; the camera lands behind Joe on Play and he stands on the plaza
instead of falling through. What it cannot verify without the user is **feel**, which is the whole
point of the unit. Controls:

| key | does |
| --- | --- |
| `W` / `S` | forward / back along whatever Joe faces |
| `A` / `D` | turn Joe left / right (tank controls — the camera follows the body, it does not steer it) |
| `Shift` | sprint, 7.0 m/s, drains stamina |
| `Alt` | jog, 4.5 m/s |
| nothing | walk, 2.0 m/s |
| `Space` | jump |

What to judge: does the turn rate feel right, does the camera trail nicely or lag/whip, do curbs
step up cleanly, does Joe stop at walls. Speeds and stamina are ported values, not re-derived, so
they may want tuning by eye. **Joe will slide in a fixed walk pose — that is expected, the animator
is U7.**

Then U7 (animator state machine) reads `PlayerController.CurrentGait` / `.CurrentPose`, which are
already published for it.

**The world is generated, not hand-placed.** `World.unity` holds four roots:
`Main Camera`, `Directional Light`, `Player_Joe`, and `World` — everything under `World` is
WorldBuilder's output and is destroyed and rebuilt on every run. **Never hand-edit anything under
`World`**; change `config.ts` or `WorldBuilder.cs` instead.

The pipeline, end to end:

```
game repo  src/config.ts
   → scripts/export-config.mjs            (the game repo's ONLY permitted change)
   → tools/export-config.sh               (this repo — holds the port-specific paths)
   → Assets/StreamingAssets/theblock-config.json   (gitignored, 61 KB, whole config)
   → TheBlockConfig.Load()                (Assets/Scripts/Core/TheBlockConfig.cs)
   → The Block → Build World              (Assets/Editor/WorldBuilder.cs, applies Convert)
```

Last build: **9 placed, 4 missing, 96 colliders, 0.6 s** — 7 districts, the 7-Eleven, the pizza
place. Every district reproduces its previously hand-placed transform exactly, and the facade tint
rebinds to `Facade.mat` on its own.

**Missing assets — the world builds fine without them, they are logged not fatal:**

| config url | needed for | status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reichman.glb` | Reichman University district | hand-modelled, no Sketchfab original |
| `parking-lot.glb` | Parking Lot district | hand-modelled, no Sketchfab original |
| `gas-station.glb` | U13, fuel | not yet ingested |
| `police-station.glb` | U13, U19 | not yet ingested |

For the two hand-modelled ones, check `blender/` in the game repo and `source-assets/Untitled.blend`
first; else fall back to the shipped GLBs (271 KB / 497 KB, so the loss is small).

**Pizza place is a stand-in.** `Assets/Models/Places/low_poly_pizza_restaurant.glb` (370 KB, user
sourced 2026-08-13) fills in for `pizza-lila.glb` via `WorldBuilder.AssetAliases`, which warns on
every build so a substitute never quietly passes for the real thing. Its node `PizzaLight` matched
the config's `hideNodes`, which suggests it is the same Sketchfab base the original was built from —
so `scale: 1.6` is probably right, but it still wants an eyeball.

**Known issues, all belong to U11:**
- Foliage renders as white shards — imported `alphaMode: BLEND` with ZWrite off. Alpha-clip is the
  right fix but glTFast's Shader Graph ignores `_AlphaClip`; the surface mode has to be driven
  another way. Attempted and reverted, not left half-applied.
- Cities 2 and 3 each have one renderer that mixes the baked-in parked cars with real geometry, so
  `hideMaterials` cannot strip them without taking buildings too. They stay visible; a submesh split
  in Blender is the fix. Every other district hides its cars cleanly.
- Districts are merged meshes, so `noCollidePatterns` almost never matches — a district gets 2–4
  whole-mesh colliders, palms included. The web build has the same hole, so this is faithful rather
  than broken, but raw multi-node sources would let the filter actually work.

**District GLBs are gitignored** (40–85 MB each; free LFS is 1 GiB and shared with the original
repo). Working copies live in `Assets/Models/City/`, zips in `~/TheBlockSource/cities/zips/`. A
fresh clone opens `World.unity` with the districts missing until those are restored — deliberate.
`first-one.glb` is the exception: 240 KB and the only copy anywhere, so it is committed.

**Requires:** a session with cwd `~/TheBlockUnity` (the MCP server is scoped to that path) and the
game repo added via `/add-dir`. See `CLAUDE.md` §2.

## Units

State: `todo` · `wip` (half-built — the notes column MUST say exactly what and what's next) · `done`

### Tier 0 — Pipeline
| id | unit | state | commit | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U0 | Project setup — Unity, MCP, git, LFS, docs | done | `dacca07` | Unity 6000.5.8f1 URP; MCP v10.1.2 HTTP Local :8080; remote pushed |
| U1 | glTF import path — glTFast + Draco, downtown solid | done | `5a0b58f` | glTFast 6.19.0 + Draco 5.4.3; `World.unity` is build scene 0; asset needed zero fixup |
| U2 | Character import — Mixamo FBX as Humanoid, walk clip | done | `13cea9f` | `JoeAvatar` isHuman, 52 bones; clips `Joe_Idle`/`Joe_Walk` loop. Bones were `mixamorig7:` — suffix varies per export, Humanoid makes it moot |
| U3 | `Convert` handedness helper | done | `16fe0ee` | Negate X. `Assets/Scripts/Core/Convert.cs`; verified 8/8 against the placed scene objects |
| U4 | `export-config.mjs` → `theblock-config.json` | done | `62d917a` | Whole config, not a subset — the game repo gets one change ever, so a subset would force re-editing it at U12/U13/U17. 61 KB, byte-identical across runs |
| U5 | `WorldBuilder` Editor script | done | `62d917a` | Menu **The Block → Build World**. User-confirmed 2026-08-13: their run reproduced the report line for line — 9 placed, 4 missing, 96 colliders |

### Tier 1 — Traversal
| id | unit | state | commit | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U6 | Character controller + camera follow | wip | `1905f94` | **Built, compiles clean, camera verified behind Joe; awaiting the user's feel test.** `Assets/Scripts/Player/{PlayerController,FollowCamera}.cs` on `Player_Joe` / `Main Camera`. Next action: user walks him around and says whether it feels right. Nothing left to code |
| U7 | Animator state machine (idle/walk/run/jump) | todo | | Reads `PlayerController.CurrentGait` / `.CurrentPose`, already published. `Joe.controller` currently has no parameters and one looping clip |

### Tier 2 — Vehicles
| id | unit | state | commit | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U8 | Vehicle base + one drivable car | todo | | **Use `mustang`** — the only car with separate wheel nodes. tesla/audi/avenger/police had wheels merged by `merge-car-meshes.py` (a three.js draw-call fix) so they can only be traffic |
| U9 | Enter/exit state machine + seated driver | todo | | mirrors `game/game-state.ts` mode enum |
| U10 | Motorcycle | todo | | feel is re-derived, not ported — budget real time |

### Tier 3 — World
| id | unit | state | commit | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U11 | All 9 districts via WorldBuilder | todo | | Placement, colliders and the foliage filter already ship in U5's WorldBuilder. What is left: ingest `reichman` + `parking-lot`, the alpha-clip fix, and the city 2/3 submesh split |
| U12 | Roads, ground, sea | todo | | |
| U13 | Places — pizza + interior, gas, police station, lot cars | todo | | |
| U14 | Map + minimap | todo | | |
| U15 | Addressables streaming | todo | | ONLY if the profiler says so — measure first |

### Tier 4 — Living world
| id | unit | state | commit | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U16 | Pedestrian crowd (NavMesh agents) | todo | | |
| U17 | Traffic — graph, cars, lights | todo | | |
| U18 | Run-over + blood VFX | todo | | Root Motion ON — the clip's motion IS the knockback |
| U19 | Police pursuit + wanted level | todo | | real NavMesh; do NOT inherit the straight-line hack untested |

### Tier 5 — Missions
| id | unit | state | commit | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U20 | Mission framework + campaign director + persistence | todo | | |
| U21 | M1 pizza delivery | todo | | |
| U22 | M2 rhythm / dance minigame | todo | | |
| U23 | Helicopter + M3 rooftop rescue | todo | | |
| U24 | Jetski + M4 chase | todo | | |

### Tier 6 — Shell
| id | unit | state | commit | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U25 | HUD + in-game UI (UI Toolkit) | todo | | |
| U26 | Menus — title, character select, briefing, controls, pause | todo | | |
| U27 | Audio — sfx, engine, ambient, radio | todo | | |
| U28 | Economy + fuel + power-ups | todo | | |
| U29 | Character roster | todo | | |

### Tier 7 — Ship
| id | unit | state | commit | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U30 | macOS build + perf pass | todo | | watch texture memory — it killed web mobile |
| U31 | iOS / iPad | todo | | free 7-day Xcode provisioning; $99 only for distribution |
| U32 | Multiplayer | todo | | DEFERRED by decision — revisit only here |

## How to close a unit

A unit is **not done** until all three are true:

1. It play-tests correctly in the Editor, confirmed **by the user** (I cannot see the Game view).
2. This file is updated — state → `done`, commit hash filled in, `RESUME HERE` rewritten to the
   next action.
3. The commit lands.

If a unit **cannot** be finished, set it to `wip` and write in the notes exactly what is built,
what is not, and the next concrete action. Then update `RESUME HERE` to point at it. A `wip` unit
with a vague note is the one failure mode this whole system exists to prevent.

## Decisions log

Dated one-liners. These are settled — do not re-litigate them without the user reopening.

- **2026-08-12** — Scope is the **full game**, not a slice. No deadline; resumability matters more
  than speed.
- **2026-08-12** — **Unity-idiomatic, same game.** Where Unity offers a better mechanism than the
  web version's workaround, Unity wins (NavMesh police, Addressables streaming). Same missions,
  same world, same feel.
- **2026-08-12** — **Multiplayer deferred to U32.** `src/mp` + `src/net` (2,263 lines) rides on
  Supabase Realtime; none of that transport carries to Unity.
- **2026-08-12** — **Autonomous units with a checkpoint each.** Build a unit fully, update this
  ledger, commit, report. User play-tests at unit boundaries.
- **2026-08-12** — **Desktop (macOS) is the priority target**; iPad is a wanted bonus, never a
  constraint on design.
- **2026-08-12** — **No money spent, ever.** Unity Personal only. No Unity Cloud, no Unity AI
  (it bills credits), no Asset Store, no paid LFS.
- **2026-08-12** — Transport for MCP is **HTTP Local**; the remote option requires a Coplay API key
  and is off the table for the same reason.
- **2026-08-12** (U1) — **The facade tint is a material asset, not code.** The web build recolours
  `facade_5` in code at load because it cannot author materials; Unity can. `Facade.mat` costs
  nothing at runtime and is editable without a rebuild. Unity wins, per the rule above.
- **2026-08-12** — **Handedness is X negation.** `Convert.Pos = (-x, y, z)`, `Convert.Yaw = -y`.
  Established empirically on five district assets plus a landmark gap measurement, not assumed.
  Closes the biggest open risk in the port. See memory `handedness-negate-x`.
- **2026-08-12** — **Districts are built from raw Sketchfab originals, not the shipped GLBs.**
  The raw downloads share the exact coordinate frame `config.ts` documents, so they need no Blender
  normalize pass — which removes the only real cost objection. See memory
  `district-sources-match-config`.
- **2026-08-12** — **District GLBs stay out of git.** 40–85 MB each; free LFS is 1 GiB and shared
  with the original repo. Working copies in `Assets/Models/City/` are gitignored, zips archived in
  `~/TheBlockSource/cities/zips/`. `first-one.glb` is the exception — 240 KB and the only copy in
  existence, so it is committed.
- **2026-08-13** (U4) — **The exporter dumps the WHOLE config, not the subset U5 needs.** The game
  repo is permitted exactly one added file, so a subset would force re-editing it at U12, U13, U17
  and U20. The whole thing is 61 KB and `TheBlockConfig` ignores unknown fields, so the C# model can
  stay a subset and grow per unit while the exporter never changes again.
- **2026-08-13** (U4) — **No timestamp in the export; a `$sourceSha256` instead.** A timestamp would
  break byte-identical re-runs, which is what makes a stale export detectable at all.
- **2026-08-13** (U5) — **The scene is a pure function of the config plus the assets on disk.**
  WorldBuilder destroys its own root and rebuilds every run, so nothing under `World` may be
  hand-edited. Placement, the facade rebind, car hiding and colliders all live in the builder — not
  in the scene file, where they would be invisible and unreproducible.
- **2026-08-13** (U5) — **Foliage is excluded from collision only when the WHOLE renderer is
  foliage.** The district GLBs are merged meshes; "any material matches" stripped collision from
  entire districts. A mixed mesh collides, palms included — the same hole the web build has.
- **2026-08-13** (U5) — **Substitute models go in `WorldBuilder.AssetAliases`, never renamed on
  disk.** A rename hides the substitution; the alias table warns on every build. First entry is the
  pizza place.
- **2026-08-13** (U6) — **Model-local offsets need `Convert.ModelOffset`, not `Convert.Pos`.** A
  world position only crosses the handedness change; an offset in a model's own frame also crosses a
  convention change, because three.js faces `-Z` and Unity faces `+Z`. Through `Pos` the chase
  camera lands in the character's face. Z verified against Joe; X is still unverified, since every
  offset ported so far has `x = 0`.
- **2026-08-13** (U6) — **Tank controls carry over.** A/D turn the body, W/S drive along its facing,
  and the camera trails rather than steers. This is the original's design, not a three.js
  limitation, so rule 5 says it stays.
- **2026-08-13** (U6) — **Unity's `CharacterController` replaces the Rapier kinematic capsule plus
  hand-rolled collide-and-slide.** Same behaviour, one component, and it brings `stepOffset` — which
  the web build had no equivalent for and which is what gets Joe up a Florentin curb.
- **2026-08-13** (U6) — **No Cinemachine yet.** The chase camera is fifteen lines with a specific
  feel to reproduce; a camera framework earns its place at U23's helicopter and U26's menus, not
  here.
- **2026-08-12** (U1) — **Downtown gets one collider over the whole mesh.** `city.noCollidePatterns`
  matches node *or* material names; `first-one.glb` has no per-object nodes and its only foliage
  material (`AM113_072_Washingtonia_filifera`) matches no pattern — so the shipped web build
  collides with its palms too. This is faithful, not a shortcut. Build the noCollide filtering when
  the first multi-node district lands, not before.
